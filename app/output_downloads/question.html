    <p>A ball is thrown horizontally from the top of a cliff with an initial speed of <span>{params.initial_speed} m/s</span>. The cliff is <span>{params.height} m</span> high. How long does it take for the ball to hit the ground? What is the horizontal distance traveled by the ball by the time it hits the ground?</p>

    <p>Assume there is no air resistance and use the acceleration due to gravity as <span>9.8 m/s²</span>.</p>
