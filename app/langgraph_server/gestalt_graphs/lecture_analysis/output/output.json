It shows how to obtain pressure gradients in an accelerating frame, how the free surface tilts under linear acceleration, and how a rotating fluid develops a parabolic free-surface profile. The notes also apply these results to compute heights, submerged volumes, centroids, and the critical rotation rate for spilling, with geometric volume calculations for truncated and parabolic segments.", "core_topics": ["Hydrostatic pressure gradient under linear acceleration", "Tilted free surface and slope relation to acceleration", "Integration of pressure to find surface height distributions", "Geometric volume and centroid calculations for sloped/truncated containers", "Pressure field in a rotating (centrifugal) frame", "Parabolic free-surface shape in rotating fluids", "Volume of paraboloid segment and submerged volume calculations", "Critical rotation rate for overflow/spilling", "Unit discussion for volumetric flow (Q, m3/s, liters)"], "learning_objectives": ["derive the hydrostatic pressure gradient in a container subject to a constant linear acceleration", "explain and compute the slope of a free surface produced by linear acceleration", "apply hydrostatic integration to determine heights and submerged volumes in nonuniform container geometries", "derive the pressure distribution in a rotating fluid using cylindrical coordinates", "show that a rotating free surface is a paraboloid and compute its radial height profile", "calculate the volume and centroid of a parabolic free-surface segment and use this to find conditions for overflow", "determine the critical angular speed that causes fluid to spill from a rotating container", "convert and reason about common volumetric flow units (m3/s, L/s, gallons/min)"], "assumed_prerequisites": ["basic calculus (integration)", "introductory fluid statics (hydrostatic pressure)", "classical mechanics (constant acceleration and rotation concepts)", "familiarity with cylindrical coordinates and basic geometry"], "lecture_type": "derivation-heavy"}}
