Using the expression above and setting p_ref = p_a at some chosen reference (or solving for C) yields\n```\np_a = p_a - \\rho a_x x - \\rho (a_z+g) \\eta(x) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\rho a_x x + \\rho (a_z+g)\\eta(x) = 0\n```\nso the slope of the free surface is\n```\n\\frac{d\\eta}{dx} = -\\frac{a_x}{(a_z+g)}\n```", "7) Special simple case: acceleration only horizontal (a_z = 0) \u21d2 free surface is planar with slope `d\u03b7/dx = -a_x/g`. Thus the free surface tilts linearly: `\u03b7(x) = \u03b7(0) - (a_x/g) x` (constant set by total volume / reference).", "8) Rotating (rigid-body) case: use cylindrical coordinates (r,\u03b8,z) with rotation rate \u03c9 about the z axis. The effective body acceleration in radial direction is b_r = -\u03c9^2 r (points outward in inertial sense; sign convention below yields): from the radial momentum balance for a static rotating fluid we get\n```\n\\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} = \\rho \\omega^2 r,\\qquad \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial z} = -\\rho g\n```", "9) Integrate radial equation:\n```\n\\int \\frac{\\partial p}{\\partial r} \\,dr = \\int \\rho \\omega^2 r \\,dr \\implies p(r,z) = \\frac{1}{2} \\rho \\omega^2 r^2 + g_1(z)\n```", "10) Integrate vertical equation (use g_1'(z) = -\\rho g):\n```\ng_1(z) = -\\rho g z + C\n```\nso the full pressure field is\n```\n\\boxed{\\;p(r,z) = p_{ref} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\omega^2 r^2 - \\rho g z\\;}\n```", "11) Free surface (p = p_a) gives the paraboloid shape: set p(r,z)=p_a and solve for z(r):\n```\np_a = p_{ref} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\rho\\omega^2 r^2 - \\rho g z(r) \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad z(r) = z(0) + \\frac{\\omega^2 r^2}{2g}\n```\n(choose z(0) to satisfy volume or reference height). This is the standard parabolic free surface of a rotating fluid.", "12) Notes on constants / volume constraint: the additive constant z(0) (or p_ref) is fixed by global volume conservation (the total fluid volume is unchanged by tilting or rotation).
