    "lecture_summary": "The lecture analyzes fluid hydrostatics in non-inertial frames: first for a container undergoing linear acceleration (horizontal and vertical components) and then for a container rotating about its axis. It develops the pressure-gradient formulation in accelerating frames, uses those gradients to determine the free\u2011surface shape (tilted plane for linear acceleration, paraboloid for rotation), and computes resulting fluid volumes and centroids. The material also covers how these changes affect buoyancy and stability of floating bodies (center of buoyancy, metacentric considerations) and includes practical notes on volumetric flow and unit conversions.",
