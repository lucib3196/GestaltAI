    A car accelerates uniformly from rest to a speed of
    <pl-symbolic-input expected-value="v_f">30</pl-symbolic-input> m/s in
    <pl-symbolic-input expected-value="t">10</pl-symbolic-input> seconds.
    Calculate the total distance traveled by the car during this time.
  </p>
  <p>
    The formula to calculate distance traveled with constant acceleration is
    given by:
  </p>
  <p>\( d = \frac{1}{2} v_i t + \frac{1}{2} a t^2 \)</p>
  <p>
    where \( v_i \) is the initial velocity (0 m/s), \( v_f \) is the final
    velocity, \( a \) is the acceleration, and \( t \) is the time. Solve for \(
    d \).
