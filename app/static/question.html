    Consider a mass-spring system. A mass of <strong>{params.mass}</strong> kg
    is attached to a spring. When the mass is displaced by
    <strong>{params.displacement}</strong> meters from its equilibrium position
    and released, it undergoes simple harmonic motion. Calculate the spring
    constant (k) of the spring if the period of oscillation is
    <strong>{params.period}</strong> seconds.
